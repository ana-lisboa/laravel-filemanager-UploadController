# laravel-filemanager-UploadController
Based on:
https://github.com/UniSharp/laravel-filemanager 

This package's UploadController wasn't uploading files from the upload tab, on my config, so I made this 

When uploading a file from ckeditor upload tab, the file wasn't saved.
From what I found, the file wasn't being "foreached", so is wasn't being saved.
